      The term ‘restaurant’ first appeared in the 18th century in France. It referred to a reinvigorating meat broth which people ate to refortify the body. It was not until the French Revolution and subsequent industrialisation that culinary establishments such as we know them today began to appear and develop. However, the modern restaurant is not an entirely new creation. The activity of eating outside the home has existed for thousands of years.

      In the 17th century, going out specifically to eat a full meal was not yet commonplace. From the latter half of the 18th century, Paris became the capital of the modern restaurant. According to legend, in 1765 a man by the name of Monsieur Boulanger was the first to open an establishment offering a choice of restorative broths and even used the term ‘restaurant’ on the sign over his door: “Boulanger provides divine sustenance.” Then, in 1782, Antoine Beauvilliers opened his eponymous restaurant, which made his reputation. The famous French gastronome Brillat-Savarin praised him highly. It was one of the first luxury restaurants aimed at a wealthy clientele. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, chefs working for the aristocracy found themselves out of work. Those who escaped the guillotine opened their own restaurants to satisfy the refined tastes of their new clientele, the rising bourgeoisie.
